# graph-theory-year3

## Intro
My name is Ray Mannion and I am a 3rd student at the Galway/Mayo Institute of Technology studying Software Development

In this repository you will find a project I was asked to complete for a graph theory module. The project was completed using the Go programming language, which I am currently learning.

In order for you to run these programs you will need to install the [GO](https://www.google.ie/?gws_rd=cr&dcr=0&ei=SQvUWejfHOaXgAaL3JeoBA)
compiler on your computer and run the git clone command to pull the files from github.


## Run the code

Once you have installed the compiler, and have the files on your computer, open a command line of your choice. Next, navigate your way to the folder. Then run the command "go build" followed by the name of the go file(including the file extension) you wish to run.

This will then create an executeable file of the same name, but with an ".exe" ententsion. Then simpily run the .exe file and the GO program will run.
